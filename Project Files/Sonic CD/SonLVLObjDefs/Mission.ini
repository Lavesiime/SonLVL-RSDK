; (speed shoes icon, it's small and it blends in with level tiles but it should still be fine enough)
; okay so this is kinda weird - this object doesn't really need to be placed in a level, as all of its code
; is in ObjectStartup
; however.. they placed it in the level anyways, even if it doesn't even have an ObjectMain or anything
; well, in M086 (Gotta Go Fast) they didn't place it in the level, but they did in M110 (Extreme! Gotta Go Fast)
; so... originally we left the object placeable, but upon further thought, let's just keep it hidden
; just having it on the object is enough to make Sonic speed up and stuff, you don't really need to place the
; object in a level for that to happen
